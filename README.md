## Introduction
Sphere is an open-source server-oriented plugin written in Lua for Palworld. It empowers game administrators with commands, such as summoning pals, distributing item kits, and opening up exciting possibilities for the future!

## Setup
To ensure a smooth development experience, follow these steps to set up your environment:

### 1. Install Visual Studio Code Extension
The `Luahelper` extension for Visual Studio Code is essential for efficient development:

- Search for "yinfei.luahelper" and install the extension.

### 2. Generate Lua Types
To access Palworld classes and types, generate Lua type information:
2.1 Open your PalServer and the UE4SS Debugging Tools will show.
2.2 In the header, navegate to `Dumpers > Generate Lua types`.
2.3 You will find numerous files in the `shared/types` folder.

### 3. Configure Visual Studio Code
Ignore unnecessary errors in VS Code to your workflow:
3.1 Press `Ctrl+,` to open VS Code settings.
3.2 Search for `@ext:yinfei.luahelper`.

## Special Thanks
I would like to extend special thanks to the members of the UE4SS Discord server who generously shared their knowledge and helped answer my questions, making this project possible.
This project was inspired by the [aytimothy](https://github.com/aytimothy/PalworldEssentials/), where I found inspiration and motivation to start my own project.
